# Building Your First GenServer

## Coming Soon

This lesson will guide you through building a complete chat room GenServer that manages users, handles messages, and maintains state. You'll learn how to:

- Design a chat room GenServer with full functionality
- Implement user join/leave operations
- Handle message broadcasting within a room
- Manage room state and user tracking
- Add persistence and recovery capabilities

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A complete chat room GenServer
- User management with join/leave operations
- Message broadcasting to all room members
- State persistence and recovery
- A working prototype of your chat server core

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
-module(chat_room).
-behaviour(gen_server).

% State record
-record(room_state, {name, users = [], messages = []}).

% API
join_room(RoomPid, User) -> gen_server:call(RoomPid, {join, User}).
send_message(RoomPid, User, Message) -> gen_server:call(RoomPid, {message, User, Message}).
```

This lesson builds on the GenServer basics from Lesson 10 and prepares you for the supervision patterns we'll explore in Lesson 12.
