# WebSocket Protocol Implementation

## Coming Soon

This lesson will guide you through implementing the WebSocket protocol from scratch in pure Erlang. You'll learn how to:

- Implement WebSocket handshake negotiation
- Parse and generate WebSocket frames
- Handle different frame types (text, binary, ping, pong, close)
- Implement masking and unmasking for security
- Build real-time bidirectional communication

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Complete WebSocket handshake handling
- WebSocket frame parsing and generation
- Support for all WebSocket frame types
- Connection upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket
- Real-time communication foundation for your chat server

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% WebSocket handshake
generate_accept_key(Key) ->
    Magic = "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11",
    Hash = crypto:hash(sha, Key ++ Magic),
    base64:encode(Hash).

% Frame parsing
parse_frame(<<FIN:1, _RSV:3, Opcode:4, Mask:1, PayloadLen:7, Rest/binary>>) ->
    parse_payload(FIN, Opcode, Mask, PayloadLen, Rest).
```

This lesson builds on the HTTP request handling from Lesson 14 and prepares you for building the chat server core in Lesson 16.
