# Introduction to Processes

## Coming Soon

This lesson introduces Erlang's revolutionary process model - lightweight, isolated processes that communicate through message passing. You'll learn how to:

- Create and manage Erlang processes
- Understand process isolation and fault containment
- Implement the actor model for concurrent programming
- Use spawn, self, and process identifiers (PIDs)
- Build your first concurrent chat server components

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Basic process creation and management
- Simple message passing between processes
- Process monitoring and lifecycle management
- A foundation for concurrent chat server architecture
- Your first actor-based components

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Creating processes
Pid = spawn(fun() -> chat_user_process() end),
Pid ! {message, "Hello from another process"}.

% Process isolation
self() ! {internal_message, data}.
```

This lesson builds on the error handling patterns from Lesson 6 and prepares you for the inter-process communication we'll explore in Lesson 8.
