# Advanced OTP Patterns

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you advanced OTP behaviors and patterns for building sophisticated, production-ready systems. You'll learn how to:

- Use gen_fsm for complex state machine implementations
- Implement event handling with gen_event
- Create custom OTP behaviors for domain-specific needs
- Build advanced supervision strategies
- Design complex application architectures with multiple OTP components

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Complex state machines using gen_fsm
- Event-driven architecture with gen_event
- Custom OTP behaviors for specific use cases
- Advanced supervision trees with dynamic children
- Integration patterns for complex distributed systems

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% gen_fsm for user session state
-behaviour(gen_fsm).

% States: disconnected, authenticating, connected, idle
connected({message, Text}, _From, State) ->
    broadcast_message(Text),
    {reply, ok, connected, State, ?IDLE_TIMEOUT};

connected(timeout, State) ->
    {next_state, idle, State}.

% gen_event for chat events
-behaviour(gen_event).

handle_event({user_joined, User, Room}, State) ->
    notify_room_members(Room, {user_joined, User}),
    {ok, State}.

% Custom behavior
-callback handle_chat_event(Event, State) -> {ok, State} | {stop, Reason}.
```

This lesson builds on the DevOps practices from Lesson 32 and prepares you for the integration patterns we'll explore in Lesson 34.
