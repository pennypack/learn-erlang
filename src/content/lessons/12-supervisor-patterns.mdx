# Supervisor Patterns

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build supervision trees that automatically recover from failures. You'll learn how to:

- Design supervision strategies (one_for_one, one_for_all, rest_for_one)
- Configure restart policies and limits
- Implement fault isolation and recovery
- Monitor and manage child processes
- Build resilient architecture for your chat server

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A chat room supervisor managing multiple rooms
- Automatic restart policies for failed processes
- Fault isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Monitoring and alerting for system health
- A bulletproof foundation for your chat server

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
-behaviour(supervisor).

init([]) ->
    ChildSpecs = [
        #{id => chat_room_manager,
          start => {chat_room_manager, start_link, []},
          restart => permanent,
          shutdown => 5000,
          type => worker}
    ],
    {ok, {#{strategy => one_for_one, intensity => 5, period => 10}, ChildSpecs}}.
```

This lesson builds on the GenServer implementation from Lesson 11 and prepares you for the TCP socket programming we'll explore in Lesson 13.
