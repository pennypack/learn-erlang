# TCP Socket Programming

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to work with raw TCP sockets in Erlang to build the network layer of your chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Create TCP listeners and accept incoming connections
- Handle multiple concurrent client connections
- Implement message framing and parsing
- Build connection management and cleanup
- Handle network errors and disconnections

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A TCP server that accepts multiple client connections
- Connection pooling and management
- Message parsing and routing
- Network error handling and recovery
- The foundation for your chat server's network layer

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% TCP server setup
start_server(Port) ->
    {ok, Listen} = gen_tcp:listen(Port, [binary, {packet, 0}, {active, false}]),
    accept_loop(Listen).

accept_loop(Listen) ->
    {ok, Socket} = gen_tcp:accept(Listen),
    spawn(fun() -> handle_client(Socket) end),
    accept_loop(Listen).
```

This lesson builds on the supervision patterns from Lesson 12 and prepares you for the HTTP request handling we'll explore in Lesson 14.
