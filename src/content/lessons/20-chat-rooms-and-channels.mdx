# Chat Rooms and Channels

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build advanced chat room features with multiple rooms, channels, and permission systems. You'll learn how to:

- Create and manage multiple chat rooms
- Implement hierarchical channel organization
- Build permission and role-based access control
- Add moderation features and user management
- Handle room discovery and navigation

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Multiple chat room management system
- Hierarchical channel organization
- Role-based permissions and access control
- Moderation tools and user management
- Room discovery and search functionality

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Room management
-record(room, {id, name, description, type, permissions, created_by, created_at}).
-record(channel, {id, name, room_id, topic, permissions}).

% Permission system
check_permission(UserId, RoomId, Permission) ->
    case get_user_role(UserId, RoomId) of
        {ok, Role} -> has_permission(Role, Permission);
        {error, not_member} -> false
    end.
```

This lesson builds on the authentication from Lesson 18 and prepares you for the testing strategies we'll explore in Lesson 20.
