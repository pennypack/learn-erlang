# Operations and DevOps

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you modern DevOps practices for deploying and managing Erlang applications at scale. You'll learn how to:

- Build CI/CD pipelines for Erlang applications
- Containerize Erlang applications with Docker
- Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Set up automated deployment and rollback strategies
- Create monitoring and alerting for production systems

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Docker containerization for Erlang applications
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Automated monitoring and alerting setup

### Key Concepts Preview

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for Erlang application
FROM erlang:24-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY _build/prod/rel/chat_server ./
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["./bin/chat_server", "foreground"]
```

```yaml
# GitHub Actions CI/CD
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Erlang
        uses: erlef/setup-beam@v1
        with:
          otp-version: "24"
          rebar3-version: "3.18"
      - name: Run tests
        run: rebar3 eunit
```

This lesson builds on the scaling strategies from Lesson 31 and prepares you for the advanced OTP patterns we'll explore in Lesson 33.
