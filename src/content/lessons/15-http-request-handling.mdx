# HTTP Request Handling

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build a basic HTTP server in pure Erlang to handle web requests and WebSocket upgrades. You'll learn how to:

- Parse HTTP requests and extract headers
- Generate proper HTTP responses
- Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS)
- Implement content negotiation and MIME types
- Prepare for WebSocket protocol upgrades

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A basic HTTP server with request parsing
- HTTP response generation with proper headers
- Static file serving for your chat client
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Foundation for WebSocket upgrade handshakes

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% HTTP request parsing
parse_request(Data) ->
    [RequestLine | Headers] = string:split(Data, "\r\n", all),
    [Method, Path, Version] = string:split(RequestLine, " ", all),
    ParsedHeaders = parse_headers(Headers),
    {Method, Path, Version, ParsedHeaders}.
```

This lesson builds on the TCP socket programming from Lesson 13 and prepares you for the WebSocket protocol implementation we'll explore in Lesson 15.
