# Monitoring and Logging

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for your production chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Set up structured logging with proper log levels
- Implement application metrics and monitoring
- Create health checks and service discovery
- Build alerting systems for critical events
- Integrate with external monitoring platforms

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Structured logging throughout your application
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Health check endpoints and service monitoring
- Alerting rules and notification systems
- Integration with monitoring platforms like Prometheus

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Structured logging
-include_lib("kernel/include/logger.hrl").

?LOG_INFO(#{what => user_joined_room,
            user_id => UserId,
            room_id => RoomId,
            timestamp => erlang:system_time(millisecond)}).

% Metrics collection
metrics:increment_counter(chat_server, messages_sent, 1,
                         #{room_id => RoomId}).
```

This lesson builds on the production deployment from Lesson 21 and prepares you for the performance optimization we'll explore in Lesson 23.
