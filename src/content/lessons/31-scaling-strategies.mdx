# Scaling Strategies

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you advanced scaling strategies to handle millions of concurrent users on your chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Design horizontal scaling architectures
- Implement data sharding and partitioning
- Build multi-layer caching strategies
- Integrate CDN for global content delivery
- Optimize for massive concurrent connections

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Horizontal scaling with automatic node provisioning
- Data sharding across multiple database instances
- Multi-layer caching (L1, L2, distributed cache)
- CDN integration for static content delivery
- Load balancing with session affinity

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Sharding strategy
get_shard_node(UserId) ->
    ShardId = erlang:phash2(UserId) rem get_shard_count(),
    maps:get(ShardId, get_shard_map()).

% Distributed caching
cache_get(Key) ->
    case ets:lookup(l1_cache, Key) of
        [{Key, Value}] -> {ok, Value};
        [] -> 
            case distributed_cache:get(Key) of
                {ok, Value} -> 
                    ets:insert(l1_cache, {Key, Value}),
                    {ok, Value};
                not_found -> not_found
            end
    end.

% Auto-scaling triggers
monitor_load() ->
    case get_current_load() of
        Load when Load > 0.8 -> trigger_scale_up();
        Load when Load < 0.3 -> trigger_scale_down();
        _ -> ok
    end.
```

This lesson builds on the advanced security from Lesson 30 and prepares you for the operations and DevOps practices we'll explore in Lesson 32.
