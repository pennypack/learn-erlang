# Node Discovery and Clustering

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build dynamic, self-healing clusters with automatic node discovery and health monitoring. You'll learn how to:

- Implement service discovery mechanisms
- Build automatic cluster formation and joining
- Create health monitoring and failure detection
- Handle dynamic node scaling and removal
- Implement cluster consensus and leader election

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Automatic node discovery using DNS or service registry
- Dynamic cluster formation and membership management
- Health monitoring with failure detection
- Cluster consensus algorithms
- Self-healing mechanisms for node failures

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Node discovery
discover_nodes() ->
    {ok, Nodes} = inet_res:lookup("chat-cluster.internal", in, srv),
    [list_to_atom("chat@" ++ Host) || {_, _, _, Host} <- Nodes].

% Cluster formation
form_cluster(Nodes) ->
    lists:foreach(fun(Node) ->
        case net_adm:ping(Node) of
            pong -> ok;
            pang -> ?LOG_WARNING("Failed to connect to ~p", [Node])
        end
    end, Nodes).

% Health monitoring
monitor_cluster_health() ->
    timer:apply_interval(30000, ?MODULE, check_node_health, []).
```

This lesson builds on the distributed systems basics from Lesson 25 and prepares you for the distributed chat architecture we'll explore in Lesson 27.
