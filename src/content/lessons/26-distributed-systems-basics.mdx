# Distributed Systems Basics

## Coming Soon

This lesson will introduce you to distributed Erlang systems and how to build scalable, fault-tolerant chat servers across multiple nodes. You'll learn how to:

- Understand distributed Erlang fundamentals
- Set up node communication and clustering
- Handle network partitions and split-brain scenarios
- Implement distributed process management
- Build consensus algorithms for distributed state

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Multi-node Erlang cluster setup
- Inter-node communication patterns
- Network partition detection and handling
- Distributed process registry
- Basic consensus mechanisms for distributed state

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Node connection
net_adm:ping('chat_server@node2.example.com'),
nodes(). % List connected nodes

% Distributed process spawning
Pid = spawn('chat_server@node2.example.com', chat_room, init, [RoomId]),
global:register_name({chat_room, RoomId}, Pid).

% Handling network partitions
net_kernel:monitor_nodes(true),
receive
    {nodeup, Node} -> handle_node_up(Node);
    {nodedown, Node} -> handle_node_down(Node)
end.
```

This lesson builds on the database integration from Lesson 24 and prepares you for the node discovery and clustering we'll explore in Lesson 26.
