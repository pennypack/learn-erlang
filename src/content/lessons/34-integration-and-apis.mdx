# Integration and APIs

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build REST APIs and integrate your chat server with external services and systems. You'll learn how to:

- Build RESTful APIs for chat server operations
- Integrate with external authentication providers
- Implement message queues for asynchronous processing
- Connect to external services (email, push notifications)
- Build webhook systems for real-time integrations

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Complete REST API with proper HTTP semantics
- OAuth2 integration with external providers
- Message queue system for background processing
- Email and push notification integrations
- Webhook system for external service notifications

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% REST API endpoint
handle_request("POST", "/api/rooms", Headers, Body, Req) ->
    case authenticate_request(Headers) of
        {ok, UserId} ->
            {ok, RoomData} = json:decode(Body),
            case chat_room_manager:create_room(UserId, RoomData) of
                {ok, Room} -> 
                    {201, #{"Content-Type" => "application/json"}, 
                     json:encode(Room), Req};
                {error, Reason} -> 
                    {400, #{}, json:encode(#{error => Reason}), Req}
            end;
        {error, unauthorized} ->
            {401, #{}, <<"Unauthorized">>, Req}
    end.

% Message queue integration
publish_notification(UserId, Message) ->
    amqp_channel:cast(get_channel(), 
                     #'basic.publish'{exchange = <<"notifications">>},
                     #amqp_msg{payload = json:encode(#{user_id => UserId, 
                                                      message => Message})}).
```

This lesson builds on the advanced OTP patterns from Lesson 33 and prepares you for the final project review in Lesson 35.
