# Distributed Chat Architecture

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to design and implement a fully distributed chat server architecture. You'll learn how to:

- Design distributed system architecture for chat servers
- Implement load balancing and connection distribution
- Ensure data consistency across multiple nodes
- Build distributed message routing and delivery
- Handle cross-node user sessions and room management

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Complete distributed chat server architecture
- Load balancing with sticky sessions
- Distributed message routing and delivery
- Cross-node data consistency mechanisms
- Distributed user session and room management

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Distributed room management
get_room_node(RoomId) ->
    Hash = erlang:phash2(RoomId),
    Nodes = [node() | nodes()],
    lists:nth((Hash rem length(Nodes)) + 1, Nodes).

% Cross-node message routing
route_message(RoomId, Message) ->
    TargetNode = get_room_node(RoomId),
    case TargetNode =:= node() of
        true -> chat_room:send_message(RoomId, Message);
        false -> rpc:call(TargetNode, chat_room, send_message, [RoomId, Message])
    end.

% Distributed user sessions
global:register_name({user_session, UserId}, self()).
```

This lesson builds on the node discovery and clustering from Lesson 26 and prepares you for the fault tolerance patterns we'll explore in Lesson 28.
