# Building the Chat Server Core

## Coming Soon

This lesson will integrate all the components you've built into a complete, working chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Integrate WebSocket connections with chat rooms
- Implement message routing and delivery
- Build user session management
- Create room discovery and management
- Handle connection lifecycle events

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A complete chat server with multiple rooms
- User session management with authentication
- Message routing and delivery systems
- Room creation and management
- A working real-time chat application

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Chat server architecture
-module(chat_server).
-behaviour(gen_server).

% Core functionality
handle_websocket_message(UserId, RoomId, Message) ->
    case chat_room_manager:send_message(RoomId, UserId, Message) of
        ok -> broadcast_to_room(RoomId, {message, UserId, Message});
        {error, Reason} -> send_error(UserId, Reason)
    end.
```

This lesson builds on the WebSocket protocol from Lesson 15 and prepares you for the message broadcasting patterns we'll explore in Lesson 17.
