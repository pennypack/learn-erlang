# Hot Code Reloading

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to implement hot code reloading for zero-downtime deployments and live system updates. You'll learn how to:

- Understand Erlang's hot code reloading mechanisms
- Design modules for safe hot code updates
- Implement version management and rollback strategies
- Handle state migration during code updates
- Build automated deployment pipelines with hot reloading

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Hot code reloading infrastructure
- State migration mechanisms for GenServers
- Version management and rollback capabilities
- Automated deployment with zero downtime
- Testing frameworks for hot code updates

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Code upgrade callback
code_change(OldVsn, State, Extra) ->
    case OldVsn of
        "1.0.0" -> migrate_state_v1_to_v2(State);
        "1.1.0" -> migrate_state_v11_to_v2(State);
        _ -> {ok, State}
    end.

% Hot code loading
load_new_code(Module, Binary) ->
    case code:load_binary(Module, atom_to_list(Module) ++ ".beam", Binary) of
        {module, Module} -> {ok, loaded};
        {error, Reason} -> {error, Reason}
    end.

% Release upgrade
release_handler:install_release("2.0.0"),
release_handler:make_permanent("2.0.0").
```

This lesson builds on the fault tolerance from Lesson 28 and prepares you for the advanced security measures we'll explore in Lesson 30.
