# Records and Complex Data Structures

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to define and work with Erlang records and complex data structures. You'll learn how to:

- Define custom record types for structured data
- Create nested data structures for complex domain models
- Use type-safe patterns for data validation
- Build efficient data access and manipulation functions
- Design scalable data models for chat server entities

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- User and message record definitions
- Chat room and channel data structures
- Type-safe data access patterns
- Validation functions for complex data types
- A foundation for the chat server's data layer

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Record definitions
-record(user, {id, name, email, status, joined_at}).
-record(message, {id, user_id, room_id, content, timestamp}).

% Type-safe data access
User = #user{name="Alice", status=online},
UserName = User#user.name.
```

This lesson builds on the data manipulation skills from Lesson 4 and prepares you for the error handling patterns we'll explore in Lesson 6.
