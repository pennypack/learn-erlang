# Performance Optimization

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to profile and optimize your chat server for maximum performance. You'll learn how to:

- Profile Erlang applications to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- Improve message passing and process efficiency
- Implement caching strategies for better performance
- Load test and benchmark your optimizations

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Performance profiling and benchmarking tools
- Memory optimization and garbage collection tuning
- Message passing optimization strategies
- Caching layers for frequently accessed data
- Load testing framework with performance metrics

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Profiling with fprof
fprof:start(),
fprof:apply(chat_server, handle_message, [Message]),
fprof:profile(),
fprof:analyse().

% Memory optimization
erlang:system_flag(min_heap_size, 1024),
erlang:system_flag(min_bin_vheap_size, 1024).

% ETS caching
ets:new(message_cache, [named_table, public, {read_concurrency, true}]).
```

This lesson builds on the monitoring from Lesson 22 and prepares you for the database integration we'll explore in Lesson 24.
