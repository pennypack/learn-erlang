# Testing Your Chat Server

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build comprehensive test suites to ensure your chat server is production-ready. You'll learn how to:

- Write unit tests for individual components
- Create integration tests for system interactions
- Implement load testing for performance validation
- Build test utilities and fixtures
- Set up continuous integration and automated testing

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Complete unit test coverage for all components
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Load testing framework for performance validation
- Test utilities and mock systems
- Automated test pipeline with CI/CD

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% EUnit testing
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

chat_room_test() ->
    {ok, Pid} = chat_room:start_link("test_room"),
    ok = chat_room:join(Pid, "user1"),
    Users = chat_room:get_users(Pid),
    ?assertEqual(["user1"], Users).

% Common Test
init_per_suite(Config) ->
    {ok, _} = application:ensure_all_started(chat_server),
    Config.
```

This lesson completes the Building Phase by building on the chat rooms from Lesson 19 and prepares you for the production deployment we'll explore in Lesson 21.
