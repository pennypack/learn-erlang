# Basic Process Communication

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how processes communicate and coordinate in Erlang systems. You'll learn how to:

- Send and receive messages between processes
- Implement synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
- Use process linking for fault propagation
- Create basic supervision relationships
- Build reliable message-passing protocols

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A chat user process that handles messages
- Process linking for fault tolerance
- Basic supervision patterns
- Message protocol design for chat operations
- A foundation for the OTP patterns to come

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Message passing
UserPid ! {send_message, "Hello world"},
receive
    {message_sent, Result} -> handle_result(Result);
    {error, Reason} -> handle_error(Reason)
end.

% Process linking
link(UserPid),
trap_exit(true).
```

This lesson completes the Foundation Phase by building on the process creation from Lesson 7 and prepares you for the OTP principles we'll explore in Lesson 9.
