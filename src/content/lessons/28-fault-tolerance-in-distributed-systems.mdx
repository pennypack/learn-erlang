# Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build fault-tolerant distributed systems that gracefully handle failures and recover automatically. You'll learn how to:

- Handle network partitions and split-brain scenarios
- Implement circuit breakers and backpressure mechanisms
- Build graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Create automatic recovery and healing mechanisms
- Design systems that fail safely and recover quickly

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Network partition detection and handling
- Circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive fault tolerance testing

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Circuit breaker pattern
-record(circuit_state, {status = closed, failures = 0, last_failure}).

call_with_circuit_breaker(Fun, Args) ->
    case get_circuit_state() of
        #circuit_state{status = open} -> {error, circuit_open};
        #circuit_state{status = half_open} -> try_call(Fun, Args);
        #circuit_state{status = closed} -> execute_call(Fun, Args)
    end.

% Split-brain detection
detect_split_brain() ->
    ExpectedNodes = application:get_env(chat_server, cluster_nodes, []),
    ConnectedNodes = [node() | nodes()],
    case length(ConnectedNodes) < (length(ExpectedNodes) div 2) + 1 of
        true -> enter_minority_mode();
        false -> normal_operation()
    end.
```

This lesson builds on the distributed chat architecture from Lesson 27 and prepares you for the hot code reloading techniques we'll explore in Lesson 29.
