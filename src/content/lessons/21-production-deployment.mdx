# Production Deployment

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to deploy your chat server to production environments. You'll learn how to:

- Create production releases with rebar3
- Configure applications for different environments
- Set up process management and monitoring
- Handle configuration secrets and environment variables
- Deploy to cloud platforms and manage infrastructure

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Production-ready release packages
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Process management and service integration
- Deployment automation and scripts
- Health checks and readiness probes

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Release configuration
{relx, [
    {release, {chat_server, "1.0.0"}, [chat_server]},
    {dev_mode, false},
    {include_erts, true},
    {system_libs, true},
    {extended_start_script, true}
]}.

% Environment configuration
{prod, [
    {chat_server, [
        {port, 8080},
        {max_connections, 10000}
    ]}
]}.
```

This lesson begins the Advanced Phase by building on the testing from Lesson 20 and prepares you for the monitoring and logging we'll explore in Lesson 22.
