# Recursion and Higher-Order Functions

## Coming Soon

This lesson will cover Erlang's powerful recursive programming model and higher-order functions that make data processing elegant and efficient. You'll learn how to:

- Write recursive functions that process lists and trees
- Use map, filter, and fold operations for data transformation
- Build a message history system for our chat server
- Understand tail recursion and performance optimization
- Apply functional programming patterns to real-world problems

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A recursive message processor that handles chat history
- List manipulation functions using higher-order operations
- Efficient data transformation pipelines
- A foundation for the chat server's message handling system

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Recursive list processing
process_messages([]) -> [];
process_messages([Message | Rest]) ->
    [transform_message(Message) | process_messages(Rest)].

% Higher-order functions
Messages = ["hello", "world", "chat"],
UpperMessages = lists:map(fun string:uppercase/1, Messages).
```

This lesson builds directly on the pattern matching skills from Lesson 2 and prepares you for the process-based architecture we'll explore in Lesson 4.
