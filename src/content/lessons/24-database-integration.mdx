# Database Integration

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to integrate persistent storage solutions with your chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Use ETS tables for high-performance in-memory storage
- Integrate with external databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Design efficient data models for chat applications
- Implement data migration and versioning strategies
- Build connection pooling and transaction management

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- ETS-based caching and session storage
- Database connection pooling and management
- Data access layer with CRUD operations
- Message persistence and history retrieval
- Data migration and schema management

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% ETS table management
-define(USER_TABLE, user_sessions).
-define(MESSAGE_TABLE, message_history).

init_tables() ->
    ets:new(?USER_TABLE, [named_table, public, {read_concurrency, true}]),
    ets:new(?MESSAGE_TABLE, [named_table, public, ordered_set]).

% Database connection
{ok, Conn} = epgsql:connect("localhost", "chat_user", "password", [
    {database, "chat_server"},
    {timeout, 5000}
]).
```

This lesson builds on the performance optimization from Lesson 23 and prepares you for the distributed systems concepts we'll explore in Lesson 25.
