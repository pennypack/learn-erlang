# Real-time Message Broadcasting

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to build efficient message broadcasting systems for instant delivery across your chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Implement publish/subscribe patterns for message distribution
- Build efficient message routing algorithms
- Handle message delivery guarantees and failures
- Optimize for high-throughput message broadcasting
- Implement presence and typing indicators

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:

- Efficient pub/sub message distribution
- Real-time typing indicators and presence
- Message delivery confirmation systems
- Optimized broadcasting for large numbers of users
- Advanced message routing and filtering

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Message broadcasting system
broadcast_to_room(RoomId, Message) ->
    Users = chat_room:get_users(RoomId),
    lists:foreach(fun(User) ->
        websocket_handler:send_message(User#user.pid, Message)
    end, Users).

% Pub/sub pattern
subscribe_to_room(UserId, RoomId) ->
    gen_event:add_handler(room_events, {user_handler, UserId}, []).
```

This lesson builds on the chat server core from Lesson 16 and prepares you for the user authentication we'll explore in Lesson 18.
