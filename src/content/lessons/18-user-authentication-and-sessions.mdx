# User Authentication and Sessions

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to implement secure authentication and session management for your chat server. You'll learn how to:

- Design secure user authentication systems
- Implement session management and token validation
- Build user registration and login flows
- Handle password hashing and security best practices
- Implement authorization and access control

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Secure user registration and login systems
- Session token generation and validation
- Password hashing and security measures
- User authorization and access control
- Session persistence and cleanup

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% User authentication
authenticate_user(Username, Password) ->
    case user_store:get_user(Username) of
        {ok, User} ->
            case verify_password(Password, User#user.password_hash) of
                true -> generate_session_token(User);
                false -> {error, invalid_credentials}
            end;
        {error, not_found} -> {error, user_not_found}
    end.
```

This lesson builds on the message broadcasting from Lesson 17 and prepares you for the chat rooms and channels we'll explore in Lesson 19.
