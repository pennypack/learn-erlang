# Advanced Security

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you how to implement comprehensive security measures for production chat servers. You'll learn how to:

- Implement advanced authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2)
- Build fine-grained authorization and access control
- Create rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add encryption and secure communication

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Input validation and XSS protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive messages

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% JWT token validation
validate_jwt_token(Token) ->
    try
        {ok, Claims} = jwt:decode(Token, application:get_env(chat_server, jwt_secret)),
        case maps:get("exp", Claims) > erlang:system_time(second) of
            true -> {ok, Claims};
            false -> {error, token_expired}
        end
    catch
        error:Reason -> {error, invalid_token}
    end.

% Rate limiting
rate_limit_check(UserId, Action) ->
    Key = {rate_limit, UserId, Action},
    case ets:update_counter(rate_limits, Key, 1, {Key, 0}) of
        Count when Count =< get_limit(Action) -> ok;
        _ -> {error, rate_limit_exceeded}
    end.

% Input sanitization
sanitize_message(Message) ->
    CleanMessage = re:replace(Message, "<[^>]*>", "", [global, {return, binary}]),
    validate_length(CleanMessage, 500).
```

This lesson builds on the hot code reloading from Lesson 29 and prepares you for the scaling strategies we'll explore in Lesson 31.
