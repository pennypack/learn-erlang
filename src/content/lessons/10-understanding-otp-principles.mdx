# Understanding OTP Principles

## Coming Soon

This lesson introduces the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) - the battle-tested framework that powers Erlang's legendary fault tolerance. You'll learn how to:

- Understand the actor model and its implementation in OTP
- Design supervision trees for fault isolation
- Learn OTP behaviors and when to use each
- Implement the "let it crash" philosophy
- Build the foundation for production-ready systems

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A basic supervision tree structure
- Understanding of GenServer, Supervisor, and Application behaviors
- Fault tolerance patterns for chat server components
- The architectural foundation for your chat server
- Error isolation and recovery strategies

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% OTP supervision tree
-behaviour(supervisor).

init([]) ->
    Children = [
        {chat_room_sup, {chat_room_sup, start_link, []},
         permanent, 5000, supervisor, [chat_room_sup]}
    ],
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, Children}}.
```

This lesson builds on the process communication from Lesson 8 and prepares you for the GenServer implementation we'll explore in Lesson 10.
