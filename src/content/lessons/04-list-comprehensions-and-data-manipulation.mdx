# List Comprehensions and Data Manipulation

## Coming Soon

This lesson will explore Erlang's powerful list comprehension syntax and advanced data manipulation techniques. You'll learn how to:

- Write elegant list comprehensions for filtering and transforming data
- Use generators and filters to process complex data structures
- Build efficient data transformation pipelines
- Apply advanced filtering and sorting techniques
- Create data validation and sanitization functions

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A comprehensive message filtering system
- User data validation and transformation utilities
- Efficient data processing pipelines for chat server operations
- Advanced sorting and grouping functions

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% List comprehensions for filtering and transforming
ActiveUsers = [User || {User, Status} <- Users, Status =:= active],
ValidMessages = [Msg || Msg <- Messages, is_valid_message(Msg)].
```

This lesson builds on the recursive patterns from Lesson 3 and prepares you for the complex data structures we'll use in Lesson 5.
