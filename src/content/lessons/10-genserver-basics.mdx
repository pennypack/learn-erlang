# GenServer Basics

## Coming Soon

This lesson will teach you GenServer - the most important OTP behavior for building stateful, concurrent servers. You'll learn how to:

- Implement the GenServer behavior and its callbacks
- Manage server state across multiple client requests
- Handle synchronous and asynchronous calls
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Build the foundation for your chat server components

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- A basic GenServer with state management
- Synchronous and asynchronous API functions
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Performance considerations for GenServers
- A template for chat server components

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
-behaviour(gen_server).

% API
start_link() -> gen_server:start_link(?MODULE, [], []).
get_state(Pid) -> gen_server:call(Pid, get_state).
update_state(Pid, NewState) -> gen_server:cast(Pid, {update, NewState}).

% Callbacks
handle_call(get_state, _From, State) -> {reply, State, State};
handle_cast({update, NewState}, _State) -> {noreply, NewState}.
```

This lesson builds on the OTP principles from Lesson 9 and prepares you for building your first GenServer in Lesson 11.
