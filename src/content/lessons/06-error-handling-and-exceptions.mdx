# Error Handling and Exceptions

## Coming Soon

This lesson will cover Erlang's unique approach to error handling and the "let it crash" philosophy. You'll learn how to:

- Understand Erlang's error handling philosophy
- Use try-catch blocks for controlled error recovery
- Implement defensive programming patterns
- Handle different types of errors (throws, errors, exits)
- Build fault-tolerant functions that gracefully handle failures

### What You'll Build

By the end of this lesson, you'll have implemented:
- Robust error handling for chat server operations
- Validation functions with comprehensive error reporting
- Recovery strategies for common failure scenarios
- Logging and monitoring for error tracking
- A foundation for the fault-tolerant architecture

### Key Concepts Preview

```erlang
% Error handling patterns
try
    validate_user_input(Input)
catch
    error:{invalid_input, Reason} -> {error, Reason};
    throw:validation_failed -> {error, invalid_data}
end.
```

This lesson builds on the structured data from Lesson 5 and prepares you for the process-based error handling we'll explore in Lesson 7.
